## Brief

Below is the tailored brief we followed for the project:

**Abstract**

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or *prototype* to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. The target audience of the app will be adults.

**MVP**

A user should be able to:

- view educational content on global environmental topics
- view collections of different subjects and work through the pages to learn
- save progress on current learning e.g. mark a topic as read
- test their knowledge with interactive quizzes

**Extensions**

- [x] A dashboard that tracks the users learning with charts/graphs, based on their interactions with the website
- [x] Use new React libraries and components
- [ ] Use external api to show the user realtime information
- [x] Multiple users
- [ ] Allow users to share information through social media platforms

## Challenges

Here are some of the things we found difficult:

* File structuring & naming conventions as the project scaled up in size.
* Material UI version issues for multiple developers on the same team.
* CSS, React & Material UI - compatibility problems with components using CSS .

## Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git.
**From Terminal:**

``` git clone git@github.com:knowles28/group_project_education_app ``` 

Once the download has ended, move into the directory named 'client' by running the following command:

``` cd client ``` 
  
Now to install all the modules for the client, run this command:

``` npm i ```
  
**Deployment**

To begin, you'll need to start up the backend server. Open your terminal and type the following commands:

``` cd server ```

``` npm run server:dev  ```
  
Once the server is running, it's time to start up the front end. To do this, open your terminal in the main project directory, and move into the 'client' directory:

``` cd client ```
 
From 'client' run the following terminal command:

``` npm start ```
  
Verify it is running correctly by browsing http://localhost:3000
